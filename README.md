- **Own your identity**: Register a unique and human-readable name using a decentralized name service (DNS) like Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This eliminates the need for complex wallet addresses and creates a more user-friendly experience.

- **Send and receive secure messages**: Engage in private, peer-to-peer communication with other users on the blockchain. Messages are encrypted using state-of-the-art cryptography, ensuring only the intended recipient can access them.
